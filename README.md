Brainstorming

Our microcontrollers applications project will be directed at developing an device that simulates the movement of a residual limb of a child with symbrachydactyly. This device will be used to help test prosthetic hands that are being developed to help children with this condition. The artificial residual limb will have a range of motion of at least 60 degrees in one direction that simulates flexion and extension of the wrist. The project will utilize a GUI to accept varying user inputs of desired flexion or extension degrees. The user will be able to control the artificial limb position with a precision of 10 degrees, as well as selecting the speed and number of repetitions of flexion and extension that the limb performs. 

Use Cases:
* Change the position of the arm
* Change the number of repetitions 
* Changing the speed
* Changing the diameter of the residual limb
* Changing the direction of motion from extension/flexion to ulnar/radial deviation
	* This is currently outside of the scope but would be cool to keep in mind for the future
